Welfare Implications of a Discretized Sequential Hotelling Firm Location Choice Model
=====================================================================================

## Paper Abstract
We investigate the implications of introducing sequential firm entry into Hotelling’s location choice model. We computationally solve firms’ location decisions in a discrete [0,1] space. We then examine how consumer welfare can be affected by the firms’ sequential location choices. Using this framework, we can consider the effects of government interventions on consumer welfare.
